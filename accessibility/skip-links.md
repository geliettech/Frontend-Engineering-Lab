# Skip Links: Letting Keyboard Users Bypass Repetitive Navigation

> **Topic:** Accessibility · **Level:** Beginner · **Author:** [@Odunsih1](https://github.com/Odunsih1)

## The Problem

Open an admin panel with a persistent sidebar, say, the usual Dashboard / Students / Fingerprint Enrollment / Reports / Settings links, and try navigating it using only the keyboard (no mouse). On every single page, the first 5, 10, sometimes 20+ presses of <kbd>Tab</kbd> move focus through the same sidebar links before you ever reach the actual page content: the student table, the form, the report.

A mouse user doesn't notice this because they click directly into the content. A sighted keyboard user can at least see where focus is and tab faster. But for someone using a screen reader, that repeated navigation block is read out loud, link by link, on every page load. It turns "go look at this student's enrollment status" into a tedious ritual.

This is exactly the kind of barrier WCAG's "Bypass Blocks" criterion exists for: give users a way to jump straight to the main content, skipping repeated blocks like navigation, without removing that navigation for people who do want it.

## The Solution

### 1. Add a skip link as the very first focusable element

A skip link is an anchor that jumps to the main content area. It needs to be:

- The first thing in the DOM (so it's the first stop when tabbing)
- Visually hidden by default, but visible when focused (so sighted keyboard users can see it too)
- Pointing to a real, focusable target

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx (Next.js App Router)
export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <a href="#main-content" className="skip-link">
          Skip to main content
        </a>
        <Sidebar />
        <main id="main-content" tabIndex={-1}>
          {children}
        </main>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

```css
.skip-link {
  position: absolute;
  left: -9999px;
  top: 0;
  background: #fff;
  color: #111;
  padding: 0.75rem 1.25rem;
  z-index: 100;
  border: 2px solid #2563eb;
  border-radius: 0 0 6px 0;
}

.skip-link:focus {
  left: 0;
}
```

The `left: -9999px` / `left: 0` pattern is preferred over `display: none` or `visibility: hidden`, those would also hide the link from screen readers and remove it from the tab order entirely. Moving it off-screen keeps it in the accessibility tree and tab order, it just isn't visible until it receives focus.

### 2. Make sure the target actually receives focus

Pointing `href="#main-content"` at a `<main>` element scrolls the page there, but `<main>` isn't focusable by default, so screen readers won't announce that focus moved, and the next <kbd>Tab</kbd> press could jump focus back to the top of the page. Adding `tabIndex={-1}` makes the element programmatically focusable (via script or anchor jump) without adding it to the normal tab order.

```tsx
// Before: link "works" visually, but focus doesn't move
<a href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>
...
<main id="main-content">{children}</main>

// After: focus actually lands inside main content
<a href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>
...
<main id="main-content" tabIndex={-1}>{children}</main>
```

### 3. One skip link is often enough, but add more for complex layouts

For a typical admin layout (sidebar + main content), a single "Skip to main content" link covers it. If a page has multiple large landmarks, say, a persistent sidebar *and* a secondary filter panel, you can offer more than one:

```tsx
<a href="#main-content" className="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
<a href="#student-table" className="skip-link">Skip to student list</a>
```

Don't overdo this, though, a long list of skip links becomes its own navigation burden. One or two, aimed at the largest repeated blocks, is usually right.

### 4. Place it in a shared layout, not per-page

Because the whole point is to skip something that repeats on *every* page, the skip link belongs in the root layout (or shared shell component), not duplicated in individual pages. In a Next.js app, that's `app/layout.tsx`; in another framework, it's whatever wraps your persistent navigation.

### 5. Or: let a drop-in script handle it for you

If you'd rather not hand-roll the markup and CSS above, the [`@odunsih/ally`](https://github.com/Odunsih1/ally) accessibility widget can add a skip link for you automatically, it checks the page for an existing skip link and, if none is found, injects one pointing at the main content. Add the script once, near the end of your root layout:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx (Next.js App Router)
export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <Sidebar />
        <main id="main-content" tabIndex={-1}>
          {children}
        </main>
        <script
          src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Odunsih1/ally@v1.2.0/accessibility-launcher.v1.2.0.min.js"
          defer
        />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

This is a reasonable shortcut when you're retrofitting accessibility into an existing app and don't want to touch every layout by hand. It's still worth understanding the manual approach above, the script's auto-injected skip link relies on the same idea: a focusable, initially-hidden link that's the first stop when tabbing, pointing at a focusable main content area. If your `<main>` doesn't have an `id` and isn't focusable, give it `id="main-content"` and `tabIndex={-1}` either way, so the generated link (or your own) has somewhere valid to land.

## Tradeoffs

- **When this shines:** any layout with a persistent navigation block, sidebar, header nav, breadcrumb trail, that appears identically on many pages. Admin dashboards, documentation sites, and multi-page apps benefit the most.
- **When to avoid it:** a single-page app with no repeated navigation block (e.g. a one-screen tool) gains little from a skip link, there's nothing to skip. It's not harmful to include, but it's not solving a real problem either.
- **What you give up:** almost nothing. The CSS is small, and the link is invisible to mouse users. The only ongoing cost is remembering to keep it in the shared layout when the page structure changes, e.g. if `id="main-content"` gets renamed or the `<main>` element is removed during a refactor.
- **Hand-rolled vs. drop-in script:** writing the link and CSS yourself keeps the markup self-contained and under your control, easy to test, no third-party script to load or trust. Pulling in `@odunsih/ally` saves a few minutes and is handy for retrofits, but it adds an external script dependency and a small amount of runtime work to detect and inject the link on every page load.

## Key Takeaways

- A skip link lets keyboard and screen reader users jump past repeated navigation straight to page content (WCAG 2.4.1, Bypass Blocks).
- Make it the first focusable element in the DOM, hide it visually but keep it in the accessibility tree (`left: -9999px`, not `display: none`).
- Show it on focus, so sighted keyboard users can see and use it too.
- Give the target a real `id` and `tabIndex={-1}` so focus actually moves there, not just the scroll position.
- Put it in the shared layout once, it should apply to every page that has the repeated navigation.
- If you'd rather not write it by hand, a drop-in script like `@odunsih/ally` can detect a missing skip link and inject one automatically, useful for retrofits.
